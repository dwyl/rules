# Rules

We are compiling a list of rules and common

Please help us! See below for guidelines for contributing.

## Accepting Work

### Before Starting

***Before*** a project/task can be *started*,
the person taking on the task (maker) ***must confirm***
their understanding of the *requirement(s)* from
the person who requested the task (requestor).

### Don't Accept Work you are Unable to Complete



## Chargeable Work

### What is Chargeable?

An task is *only* chargeable if it has been <br />
a) ***Formally requested*** by the requestor. <br />
b) the **definition** of "***done***" ***agreed*** prior to
starting the work/task. <br />
c) The **time required** to complete the task has been
***estimated*** before starting *and* **both parties agree**
the estimate is fair & reasonable. <br />
d) The **work** is ***complete*** per the
**definition** of "***done***". <br />
e) Any **time exceeding** the **original estimate** is
clearly & satisfactorily ***justified*** to the
requestor.

### Non-Chargeable Work

Work that has not been formally requested
by a requestor is **not chargeable**.

### Invoicing

Unless otherwise agreed ***in writing***
before work starts, invoices for work should
only be sent when the work is ***complete***.

## Time

### Don't Waste (Other People's) Time

Time is the most ***precious*** thing people have.
Wasting your own time is your decision.
Wasting the time of others - either through
laziness or negligence - is inexcusable.


### Don't "Kill" (Your Own) Time

> **Todo**: this ***needs re-wording***

Don't sit around waiting for tasks/instructions.
If you don't have *anything* to do,
*offer* to help someone.
If you don't have a **list of things to learn**,
get one.

# Guidelines

## Adding a Rule or Word Definition

Everyone is *encouraged* to add rules which
promote clearer communication, cooperation and creativity.

#### Process

The process for adding a rule is simple:
Either:

a. Submit an issue on github: https://github.com/ideaq/rules/issues
<br />***or***<br />
b. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
this rules [repository](https://github.com/ideaq/rules),
on github, add the rule and submit a
[pull-request](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request).

#### *Avoid*

Avoid creating rules which reduce
communication/innovation/creativity,
cause unreasonable bureaucracy or silos.
