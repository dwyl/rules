# Guidelines

## Adding a Rule

Everyone is *encouraged* to add rules which
promote clearer communication, cooperation and creativity.

#### Process

The process for adding a rule is simple:
Either:

a. Submit an issue on github: https://github.com/ideaq/rules/issues
<br />***or***<br />
b. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
this rules [repository](https://github.com/ideaq/rules),
on github, add the rule and submit a
[pull-request](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request).

#### *Avoid*

Avoid creating rules which reduce
communication/innovation/creativity,
cause unreasonable bureaucracy or silos.
