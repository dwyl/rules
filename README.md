# Rules

We are compiling a list of rules and common
definitions in
[***plain english***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_English). <br />
Please ***help us***!
See below for guidelines for contributing.


## Accepting Work

### *Don't Accept* Tasks *Verbally*

Its not a *request* unless its written.

If someone asks you to do something *verbally*,
ask them to ***formalise*** the request ***before***
you start.

Take the initiative to create a story in the
task tracker and send it to them to confirm
you have the details correct.


### *Before* Starting

***Before*** a project/task can be *started*,
the person taking on the task (maker) ***must confirm***
their understanding of the *requirement(s)* from
the person who requested the task (requestor).

### *Overpromising Kills Kittens*

Don't accept a task you *know* you are *unable*
to complete. If you do not have enough **time**
or **skills** to deliver a task make that *clear*
to the requestor and let her decide
if its appropriate for you to do the work.

Yes, this contradicts the idea of
"*fake it till you make it*" but it prevents
people from making promises they can't keep
(which makes everyone *sad*...)


## Chargeable Work

### What is Chargeable?

An task is *only* chargeable if it has been <br />
a) ***Formally requested*** by the requestor. <br />
b) the **definition** of "***done***" ***agreed*** prior to
starting the work/task. <br />
c) The **time required** to complete the task has been
***estimated*** before starting *and* **both parties agree**
the estimate is fair & reasonable. <br />
d) The **work** is ***complete*** per the
**definition** of "***done***". <br />
e) Any **time exceeding** the **original estimate** is
clearly & satisfactorily ***justified*** to the
requestor.

### Non-Chargeable Work

Work that has not been formally requested
by a requestor is **not chargeable**.

### Invoicing

Unless otherwise agreed ***in writing***
before work starts, invoices for work should
only be sent when the work is ***complete***.

## Time

### Don't Waste (Other People's) Time

Time is the most ***precious*** thing people have.
Wasting your own time is your decision.
Wasting the time of others - either through
laziness or negligence - is *inexcusable*.


### Don't "Kill" (Your Own) Time

> **Todo**: this ***needs re-wording***

Don't sit around waiting for tasks/instructions.
If you don't have *anything* to do,
*offer* to help someone.
If you don't have a **list of things to learn**,
get one.


## Done

### The Requestor Defines "Done" for the Task

Its the requestor

### If its *Not Documented* its *Not Done*

If you were hit by a bus, can someone else
pick up your work? No? Its not done.

# Guidelines

## Adding a Rule or Word Definition

Everyone is *encouraged* to add rules which
promote clearer communication, cooperation and creativity.

### *Process*

The process for adding/modifying a rule is simple.

***Either***: <br/>
a. Submit an issue (for discussion) on github: https://github.com/ideaq/rules/issues
<br />***or***<br />
b. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
this rules [repository](https://github.com/ideaq/rules),
on github, add the rule and submit a
[pull-request](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request).

### *Avoid*

Avoid creating rules which reduce
communication/innovation/creativity,
cause unreasonable bureaucracy or silos.
